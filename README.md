This is my project for a module called Python+.
This is a bot, with whom you can play blackjack. He has a suitable name: Jack Black. 

Commands:
/play : playing the game.

How does Jack Black work?
After you've added Jack Black to your server, start a game by saying '/play' in the designated channel. From here on,
the bot will speak for itself. 

How do you add Jack Black to your server?
Very simple. Paste:
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1150803300241903786&permissions=277027605504&scope=bot
into your browser.

WARNING
This code is not yet functional. I tried a lot, but did not get to finish in time.
