# upgraded-octo-goggles
This is my project for a module called Python+.
This is a bot, with whom you can play blackjack. He has a suitable name: Jack Black. 
Fully made in python. See requirements.txt for the required modules.

* **How does Jack Black work?**
After you've added Jack Black to your server, start a game by saying '/play' in the designated channel. From here on,
the bot will speak for itself. 

* **Commands:**
/play : playing the game.

* **How do you add Jack Black to your server?**
Very simple. Paste:
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1150803300241903786&permissions=277027605504&scope=bot
into your browser.

**WARNING**
This code is not yet fully functional. I tried a lot, but did not get to finish in time.
Everything that still needs work on, is in Dutch comments.
